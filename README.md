##Overview
This repository contains a framework for detecting mitotic figures from hematoxylin and eosin-stained whole-slide images. Details of the framework are introduced in the paper: OMG-Net: A Deep Learning Framework Deploying Segment Anything to Detect Pan-Cancer Mitotic Figures from Haematoxylin and Eosin-Stained Slides https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12773
